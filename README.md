# flickr-vue-r
This is an [equirectangular panorama](https://wiki.panotools.org/Equirectangular_Projection) viewer for flickr images made using Vuejs 3 & vuex.

It was used both as a learning project and a challenge. The main idea was to build the same application I did using React+redux ([flickr-vr-react](https://github.com/si7o/flickr-vr-react/)) to see the diferences between both frameworks.

Both, vuejs & react flickr vr viewers are a new version of an old project I did in 2013: [skybox](https://github.com/si7o/skybox).

And you can also check [my equirectangular panoramas from flickr](https://si7o.github.io/flickr-vue-r/#/photos/sitoo/) ;-).
